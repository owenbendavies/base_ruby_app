# Base Ruby App

[![CI](https://github.com/owenbendavies/base_ruby_app/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/owenbendavies/base_ruby_app/actions)

This is a simple base Ruby App which I mainly use for technical tests.

1. `./bin/setup` to set up the system
1. `./bin/test` to run all tests
1. `./bin/quality` to run code quality checks
1. `./bin/run` to run
